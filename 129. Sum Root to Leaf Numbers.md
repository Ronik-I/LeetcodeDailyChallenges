# QUESTION: 129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers

You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.
Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

A leaf node is a node with no children.

# EXAMPLE:

## Example 1: <br>
Input: root = [1,2,3]<br>
Output: 25<br>
Explanation:<br>
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.<br>
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.<br>
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.<br>

## Example 2:<br>
Input: root = [4,9,0,5,1]<br>
Output: 1026<br>
Explanation:<br>
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.<br>
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.<br>
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.<br>
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.<br>


# APPROACH:

- Use the concept of DFS traversal
- Define a recursive helper function `sum` which takes the current node and the current sum as parameters.
- If the current node is null, return 0.
- Update the current sum by multiplying it by 10 and adding the value of the current node.
- If the current node is a leaf node (both left and right children are null), return the current sum.
- Recursively calculate the sum for the left and right subtrees, passing the updated current sum.
- Return the sum of the left and right subtree sums.
- In the `sumNumbers` function, call `sum` with the root node and an initial current sum of 0.

 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}

class Solution {
public:
     int sumNumbers(TreeNode* root) {
        return sum(root, 0);
    }
    int sum(TreeNode* root, int currNum){
        if(root == nullptr) return 0;
        currNum = currNum*10+root->val;
        if(!root->left && !root->right){
            return currNum;
        }
        int l = sum(root->left, currNum);
        int r = sum(root->right, currNum);
        return l+r;
    }
};
```
